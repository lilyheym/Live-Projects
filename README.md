# Live-Projects

## AppBuilder9000
Appbuilder900 is a collaborative library full of catalogues of different subjects of interest, such as video games, or in my case, Sci-Fi television.
Included is a website with funtional create, edit, and view pages built using Python and SQL.

## Theatre
The Theatre is a work in progess collaborative project that eventually will be a fully functional local theatre website.
My work includes functional CRUD pages for rental items, built using C#, the .Net Framework, and SQL.
